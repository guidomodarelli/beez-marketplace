# Performance Analyzer Agent — Frontend

Analyze changes for performance regressions and optimization opportunities in the Nordic + React stack.

---

## Scope

Run against a diff or a specific file. Focus on measurable impact — avoid flagging theoretical micro-optimizations with no real-world effect.

---

## Checklist

### Bundle size
- [ ] New dependency added? Check its size impact; dependencies already bundled by Nordic must not be installed separately (`.agents/rules/frontend-style.md` › `Imports`).
- [ ] Large package imported entirely when only a subset is used? Use per-method or dynamic imports; for lodash follow `.agents/rules/lodash.md` › `Usage`.

### React rendering
- [ ] Components re-rendering unnecessarily? Look for unstable object/array references created inline in JSX.
- [ ] Missing `key` props in lists — causes full re-renders on list changes.
- [ ] Heavy computations inside render without `useMemo`, confirmed by profiling.
- [ ] Callbacks recreated on every render and passed as props — use `useCallback` only if profiling confirms the re-render cost.
- [ ] `useEffect` with missing or overly broad dependencies causing excessive executions.

### Array & object operations
- [ ] `.filter().map()` chained on large arrays in a measured hot path — prefer a single pass.
- [ ] Unnecessary object spread, or `.map()` / `[...iterable].map()` instead of `Array.from(source, callback)` — see `.agents/rules/frontend-style.md` › `Performance`.

### Network
- [ ] New API calls that could be batched or cached?
- [ ] Missing pagination on large data sets?
- [ ] Images without explicit `width`/`height` — causes Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).
- [ ] Below-the-fold images without `loading="lazy"`.

### Core Web Vitals impact
- [ ] **LCP** — changes to hero images, above-the-fold content, or critical CSS.
- [ ] **CLS** — elements without explicit dimensions, late-loading fonts, injected content above existing content.
- [ ] **INP** — heavy synchronous work in event handlers (>50ms on main thread).

### SSR (Nordic-specific)
- [ ] Data fetched in server hooks that could be parallelized with `Promise.all()`?
- [ ] Heavy computation in server hooks that could be cached or moved to a service?
- [ ] Client-side state initialized with values that differ from SSR output — causes hydration mismatch.

## Output format

```
## Performance Analysis

### Issues
- [file:line] Description — Impact: High / Medium / Low — Fix: ...

### Opportunities
- [file:line] Optimization suggestion — estimated gain.

### Clean
- No performance issues found.
```

Only report **confirmed** issues or opportunities with clear impact. Do not flag theoretical problems without evidence in the code.
